Git installation:
Login to AWS and connect to EC2 machine.
Install the git using  apt install git
Create a new directory using mkdir dir-name
Initialize the git using  git init  At this point logical separating will happened and working area, staging are and local repo were created

Staging areas:
Working space:  
Generally working space is the space where developer write the code. In this stage git is only aware of having files in the project
Staging area: It is an intermediate area between working space and local repo
Local repo: In is an area where user can commit the code.

Note:
1.	When the code is added to staging area, user is allow to modify/edit the code
2.	When code is committed to local repo, user is not allowed to modify the existing code

Types of Repos:		   
Local Repo   : A repository where user can create/modify/delete the files 
Central Repo: A repository where all developers’ code is stored/pushed
Remote Repo: A separate repository where user can store the code and shared with other developer without notice to all developers.

Ex: dev1 want to share his code with dev-4 without notice to dev-2 and dev-3
